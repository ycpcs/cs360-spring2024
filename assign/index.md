This page links to assignment descriptions.

All problems (unless otherwise noted) are from the course textbook:

[Introduction to Algorithms - 4th ed. (CLRS)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046305/introduction-to-algorithms/)

**All assignments must be self assessed with corrections in red ink prior to submission.**

**All assignments must be submitted as a single .pdf to Canvas**, (see the [Resources](../resources.html) page for a suggested scanning app).
